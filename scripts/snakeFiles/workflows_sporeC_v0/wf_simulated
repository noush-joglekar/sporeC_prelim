### RULES ###

rule all:
    input:
        expand("{sd}",sd=sampleDirs)


## Rule 1 ----------
### Construct a set of reads per chain

rule makeProjectionMatrices:
    """Create incidence df, binned incidence df, and projection matrices
    for chains in a given directory. If verifying, then perform for 
    a subset of chains as specified. 
    Input: Directory of chains
    Output: Directory of 2 pkl files and 1 matrix per chain

    """


## Rule 2 ----------
### Compile a hyperedge dictionary with read/ edge frequency

## Rule 3 ---------- TBD
### Prune the hypergraph to remove pre-existing read subsets

## Rule 4 -----------
### Get a background distribution of read and subset cards

## Rule 5 -----------
### Get expectedness stats and read support per read

### Rule 6 -----------
### Identify interesting reads based on cutoff. Construct a new dict

## Done.
